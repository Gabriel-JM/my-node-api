# My Typescript Node API
Its a back-end server made in Node.js with Typescript and MySQL as Database. The idea was pass my Node Vanilla JS server to a Typescript version, with less dependencies as i could.

## How to use?
```
npm i
npm start
```
1. Just type `npm i` on terminal for download all `Typescript` and `mysql2` packages.
2. And then type `npm start` on terminal to start the server.

## Config
- You'll need a database in MySQL named `my_ts_node_db` for start the server.
- By default the server listen on `3200` port, but you can change on `index.ts`.
